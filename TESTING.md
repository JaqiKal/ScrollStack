## Testing overview & environment

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire development. I used the various linters and GITPOD terminal output whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### Test environment

* Desktop:
  * Lenovo Legion T7
* Screen:
  * Samsung Odyssey G3 / 27" / 1920 x 1080 /

### Browser compatibility

* Google Chrome, version 121.0.6167.86 (Official Build) (64-bit)
* Firefox, version 123.0 (64-bit)
* Edge, version 123.0.2420.97 (Official build) (64-bit)

### Responsiveness

## Automated Testing

No automatic testing apart from using the pep8 validator was performed.

## Code Validation

### HTML

All HTML files were validated using the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org).

Exceptions:

The presence of Jinja templates in the code, which include syntax like {% for loops %}, {% url 'home' %}, and {{ variable|filter }}, means that direct copy-pasting from source files does not validate correctly.

Normally, the [validate by URI method](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) on deployed Heroku pages is suggested. However, this approach is impractical for my project because most pages require user login, and the W3C HTML Validator cannot access these authenticated pages.

**Alternative Validation Approach:**

To validate HTML pages that incorporate Jinja syntax and require authentication, I followed these steps:

Navigate to the authenticated pages on the deployed site.
Right-click on the page and select View Page Source (shortcut CTRL+U or âŒ˜+U on Mac).
This reveals the fully rendered HTML, free of Jinja syntax.
Copy this HTML and paste it into the validate by input section of the W3C validator.
This procedure was repeated for each authenticated page.

### CSS

[CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) was used to to validate the CSS file(s).

### JavaScript

[JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) was used to validate all JS files / content.

### Python

The recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) was to validate all Python files.

### Error Handling (ERR)

#### Manual steps to render error page on local host and in production

**Note:** If the project is set up to collect static files in a production-like environment (i.e., DEBUG = False), missing static files might cause warnings or errors that can affect the rendering of the error pages.

<details>
  <summary>Manual test case to simulate error in local host</summary><br>

- Manual steps to simulate error 403 in local host:

  1. Ensure the 403.html template exists in the templates/errors directory properly formatted.
  2. In scroll_core/views.py, create a test_403 function that raises a PermissionDenied.
  3. In scroll_manager/urls.py, Add URL pattern 'test_403' for testing view.
  4. In scroll_core/views.py, add a custom_403 function to return the 403 error page.
  5. In settings.py set DEBUG = True
  6. Visit localhost and add /test-403 to the end of the www url path.
  7. Verify that the custom 403.html template is displayed with the error message: "Error 403: Forbidden".

- Manual steps to simulate error 404 in local host:

  1. Ensure the 404.html template exists in the templates/errors directory properly formatted.
  2. In scroll_core/views.py, create a custom_404 function that returns a '404' response.
  3. In scroll_manager/urls.py, add the custom error handler for 404
  4. In settings.py set DEBUG = False
  5. Visit localhost and add a non-existent path such as /non-existent to the end of the www url path.
  6. Verify that the custom 404.html template is displayed with the error message: "Error 404: Not Found".

- Manual steps to simulate error 500 in local host:

  1. Ensure the 500.html template exists in the templates/errors directory properly formatted.
  2. In scroll_core/views.py, create a test_500 function that raises an exception to simulate a server error.
  3. In scroll_core/views.py, add a custom_500 error handler that returns a 500 response.
  4. In scroll_manager/urls.py, add the test_500 view.
  5. In scroll_manager/urls.py, add the custom_500 error handler.
  6. In settings.py set DEBUG = False
  7. Visit localhost and add /test-500 to the end of the www url path.
  8. Verify that the custom 500.html template is displayed with the error message: "Error 500: Internal Server Error.".

### KNOWN issue 

#### Gitpod IDE
Three notifications suggest that specific VS Code extensions are either installed or recommended in the workspace but are not listed in the .gitpod.yml file. To address these notifications and ensure consistent synchronization of these extensions across various setups, the extensions should be included under the vscode.extensions section of the .gitpod.yml file.

Tutor support has indicated that these notifications can be safely ignored as they merely warn that the three extensions are installed but not synchronized.
