## Deployment

### Prequisites

- Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed on your system.
- Verify that Python is installed on your system by checking its version. This can be done through a command in the terminal `python --version` or by running a small piece of Python code that outputs the version information.
- For installing libraries and modules, use `pip` or `pip3` depending on your Python version.

Important points for before deployment:
- The requirements for the project were added to a requirements.txt file using the command 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' in the terminal.
-  In .gitignore, include env.py to ensure sensitive information is not pushed to GitHub. 
-  In settings.py, link SECRET_KEY to the env.py file where the secret key variable is defined.
-  In settings.py, set 'DEBUG = False' to prevent verbose error pages and to prevent Django serving static files itself instead of relying on Cloudinary.
-  It is necessary to make migrations and migrate the models to the database before deployment.

### Heroku Deployment

1. **Heroku Account:**
   - Make sure you have a Heroku account. If not, sign up on the Heroku website.
   
2. **GitHub Repository:**
   - Ensure your project is hosted on GitHub.
   
3. **Heroku Dashboard:**
   - Log in to your Heroku account and go to the Heroku Dashboard.
   
4. **Create a New App:**
   - On the dashboard, click `New` and choose `Create new app`.
   
5. **App Name:**
   - Choose a unique name for your app, it cannot be the same as this app.
   
6. **Region & Create App:**
   - Choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), then Select **Create App**

7.  **The page of your project opens.**

8.  **Heroku Postgres**
    - Go to Resources Tab, Add-ons, search and add Heroku Postgres

9. **New App**
   - From the new app choose **Settings**, goto section 'Config Vars' click **Reveal Config Vars**, 
   
    - Config Vars for development of this project:
        - DATABASE_URL will be added automaticaly
        - SECRET_KEY - the django secret key can be generated here.
        - PORT = 8000
        - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
        - CLOUDINARY_URL can be obtained from cloudinary follow the steps on the website to register.
        - Google API key can be obtained here. Wou have to register with google and create new app to get the API key. Follow the instructions on the website.
        - Email host password (if any).
   
    - **Confidential credentials**
        - If one needs to use any private credentials, like CREDS.JSON, you should also add them to the Config Variables section. This is a crucial step for maintaining the security and integrity of your application, especially when it interacts with external services or APIs that require authentication. 

    - Config Vars for production:
        - DATABASE_URL
        - SECRET_KEY
        - CLOUDINARY_URL

**=> Go back to your code**

10. **Procfile**
    - Add the Procfile to your application's root directory ```echo web: node index.js > Procfile```. Heroku relies on this file to determine how to run your application, ensuring the correct setup of your web server. Use commands like `web: gunicorn PROJ_NAME.wsgi` in the Procfile to instruct Heroku on starting your web server with Gunicorn

11. In settings in your app add Heroku to ALLOWED_HOSTS

12. Add and commit the changes in your code and push to github

13. **Add Buildpack**
   - Scroll further down on the page, select **Add Buildpack**. The buildpacks will install further dependencies that are not included in the 'requirements.txt'. 
   - It's crucial to arrange the build packs correctly! First, choose Python and then Node.js. If they're not in this sequence, you can reorder them by dragging.
   
14. **Deploy**
    - From the tab above select the 'deploy section'.

15. **GitHub**
    - For deploying this project, we're using GitHub as our method. After choosing GitHub, make sure to confirm the connection. Then, search for your repository name and once Heroku finds your repository - click "connect"

16. **Choose deploy method**
    - Scroll down to the section "Automatic Deploys". 
    - Click "Enable automatic deploys" or choose "Deploy branch" and manually deploy.
    - Click "Deploy branch" wait for the app to be built. Once this is done, a message should appear letting us know that the app was successfully deployed. 
    - Click the button "View" to see the app.
