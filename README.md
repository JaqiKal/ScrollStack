## System Architecture

### Application Structure

ScrollStack is structured around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components. This separation helps manage complex development and enables efficient teamwork by segmenting the app into manageable parts.

Frontend is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a mobile-first, responsive design. I chose Bootstrap for its comprehensive library of pre-styled components and responsive grid system, which  
accelerated the development process and ensured a seamless, mobile-first user experience across different devices.

The backend architecture is built on Python and Django, where Django simplifies the application's backend logic, manages URL routing, and ensures efficient database interactions, providing a stable and efficient backbone for the app's operations.

In this project, we employ a relational database 'PostgreSQL' for its robustness, scalability, and compatibility with Django, structuring it to store user and book information in an organized manner, which optimizes data retrieval and supports complex queries efficiently.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Backend Logic

Placeholder text!

```text
- Detail the data models used, such as Book, User, Author, and Genre, explaining the relationships between them (e.g., one-to-many from Author to Book).
- Describe how business logic is implemented in Django views and models, including user authentication, book management (CRUD operations), and permissions for different user roles.
- If any external APIs or integrations are used (e.g., for user authentication, email services), explain their purposes and how theyâre incorporated into the backend.
```

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*

## Agile Development Process

### Overview of Agile Methodology

Agile methodologies and principles were used when planning and creating The ScrollStack. Development was organized by focusing on the prioritization of user story or stories. The user stories are arranged on a KanBan board, which was continuously managed throughout development to enable prioritization of the workload.

For details please follow link to: [Github Project board](https://github.com/users/JaqiKal/projects/10)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

Labels were added to user stories to assist with prioritization of tasks. The MoSCoW system involves adding labels for MUST HAVE, SHOULD HAVE, COULD HAVE and WON'T HAVE. By labelling issues in such a way, the developer can focus on completing all the MUST HAVE tasks before moving onto tasks of lower priority, this is critical when working to a tight deadline to ensure a minimum viable product is completed in time.

For details please follow link to: [Github Project board](https://github.com/users/JaqiKal/projects/10) and/or [Issues list](https://github.com/JaqiKal/ScrollStack/issues)

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Project Tracking (GitHub Projects)

The project use a Kanban board for organization, serving as a dynamic document continually managed to effectively prioritize and organize workload. The board categorized tasks into various stages, from Backlog for items not yet started to Done for completed tasks. As development commenced on a User Story, it transitioned from Backlog to In Progress, and upon completion, both the User Story and its associated Epic were moved to Done. Additionally, unresolved bugs were tracked separately until resolved, at which point they were also moved to the Done column. Kanban methodology proved invaluable in tracking project progress through its various phases, offering flexibility to adapt to the project's unique needs.

For details please follow link to: [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/JaqiKal/projects/10).

| Kanban | Description |
|--|--|
| Backlog (EPIC, US) | Items not yet started|
| Ready to Start (EPIC, US) | Tasks ready for implementation |
| In Progress (EPIC) | Epic currently being worked on |
| In Progress (US) | User story currently being worked on |

## Data Modeling and Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

This diagram serves as a quick reference to understand the database's structure at a glance.

Placeholder text!
```text
- Include a simplified ERD img
- Briefly describe the key entities, their attributes, and the types of relationships.
```

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Database Schema

For ScrollStack, we've adopted PostgreSQL for its advanced capabilities and flexibility in handling our dataset. This relational database supports essential features for our digital bookshelf, including book CRUD operations. The structure features entities like Book and User, with a one-to-many relationship from User to Books indicating ownership. Data integrity is enforced through constraints, such as foreign keys and NOT NULL, ensuring reliability and well-organized data that underpins ScrollStack's seamless functionality.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Data Flow and Architecture

ScrollStack leverages the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to optimize the flow of data between the user interface and the database, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience. Here's how it works:

When a user performs an action, such as adding a book, the request is handled by the Controller. It then interfaces with the Model to perform database operations. Upon successful database update, the Model signals the Controller, which instructs the View to update the display accordinglyâshowing the latest book list without needing a page reload.

This setup is made efficient through the use of AJAX<sup>1)</sup>, enabling asynchronous data updates that enhance user interaction. Middleware plays a critical role in routing requests, authentication, and overall data management. The MVC framework, together with AJAX and middleware<sup>2)</sup>, allows ScrollStack to provide quick and seamless updates to the user interface, facilitating a better user experience and streamlined maintenance.

<sup>1)</sup>AJAX is built into the web development environment through JavaScript and does not require external installation. It's readily available for use in creating dynamic, interactive web applications."

 <sup>2)</sup>Middleware in the context of web development acts as a bridge between the client and server, managing requests and responses, and performing various tasks such as authentication, authorization, routing, session management, error handling, data processing, logging, monitoring, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) management.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

## User Experience Design

### Strategy

The ScrollStack project is envisioned as a digital bookshelf that provides a platform for users to manage their book collections. The strategy behind this project is to leverage Full-Stack development techniques to create a user-friendly, mobile-first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that not only meets the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for book management but also incorporates authentication, profile management, searching, filtering, and responsive design. This strategy is rooted in the Agile methodology to ensure flexibility, iterative development, and user feedback incorporation throughout the project lifecycle.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Scope

To achieve our strategy, the project's scope includes:

- Developing a responsive and accessible front-end design that adheres to UX principles and accessibility guidelines.
- Implementing CRUD functionality for book management.
- Ensuring secure user authentication and authorization.
- Offering searching and filtering capabilities to enhance user interaction.
- Providing a user-friendly profile management interface.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Structure

ScrollStack is structured around a series of epics and user stories that detail the development process and features to be implemented. Each epic encompasses a broad area of functionality, such as Project Setup, Model Related Development, User Authentication, and Book Management. Within these epics, user stories break down the development tasks into manageable units, ensuring a focused and user-centered approach. The application follows a logical flow to facilitate ease of use and intuitive navigation, supporting these actions through a clear, organized database and front-end design. This structure supports the Agile methodology by allowing for adaptability and iterative improvements based on user feedback and project requirements.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Skeleton

The skeleton of ScrollStack is defined through wireframes and ERDs (Entity-Relationship Diagrams) that outline the user interface and database design. Wireframes provide a visual guide for the layout of web pages, focusing on user experience and efficient navigation. ERDs detail the database schema, illustrating the relationships between different data models such as Book, Genre, and Author. This skeletal framework serves as the blueprint for developing a structured and well-organized application that meets both functional and aesthetic requirements.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

## Frontend Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes for the ScrollStack project were created to outline the basic layout and interface elements for the core pages. These wireframes are the blueprint for developing a responsive and accessible web interface, adhering to the principles of mobile-first design.

- Home/Landing Page: Showcasing featured books and user testimonials.
- Book List Page: Displaying all books with options to filter and search.
- Book Detail Page: Providing detailed information about a book with options to edit or delete.
- User Profile Page: Allowing users to view and edit their profile information.
- Authentication Pages: Including sign-up and log-in forms.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   
### Color Scheme

The site begin with #F6E84B, a luminous shade of yellow, evoking the brightness and energy of the first rays of dawn, sparking curiosity right at the top of our interface. As the gradient flows into #ff9102, a vivid orange akin to the morning sun's warm glow, it subtly encourages the user to remain engaged and interact with the content. The gradient culminates in a deep maroon (#800000), grounding the design with a sense of depth and seriousness, reflecting the solid foundation of the knowledge within.

This choice of gradient not only provides a striking backdrop but also supports the user's visual flow from the top of the page to the bottom, naturally guiding them through the content. The color transition from light to dark symbolizes the user's progression from initial curiosity to deeper engagement with our application. The goal is to make this transition as smooth and natural as reading a page, ensuring that the users' experiences are both visually appealing and emotionally resonant.

12. Add and commit the changes in your code and push to github

13. **Add Buildpack**
   - Scroll further down on the page, select **Add Buildpack**. The buildpacks will install further dependencies that are not included in the 'requirements.txt'. 
   - It's crucial to arrange the build packs correctly! First, choose Python and then Node.js. If they're not in this sequence, you can reorder them by dragging.
   
14. **Deploy**
    - From the tab above select the 'deploy section'.

15. **GitHub**
    - For deploying this project, we're using GitHub as our method. After choosing GitHub, make sure to confirm the connection. Then, search for your repository name and once Heroku finds your repository - click "connect"

16. **Choose deploy method**
    - Scroll down to the section "Automatic Deploys". 
    - Click "Enable automatic deploys" or choose "Deploy branch" and manually deploy.
    - Click "Deploy branch" wait for the app to be built. Once this is done, a message should appear letting us know that the app was successfully deployed. 
    - Click the button "View" to see the app.
